    <h2>The Night Before Christmas</h2>
    <div id="theStory">
        'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house <br>
        Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>
        The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
        In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br><br>

        The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
        While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br>
        And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>
        Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br><br>

        When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
        I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>
        Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
        Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br><br>

        The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br>
        Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br>
        When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
        But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br><br>

        With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>
        I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
        More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>
        And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br><br>

        "Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!<br>
        On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONDER and BLITZEN!<br>
        To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>
        Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br><br>

        As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
        When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,<br>
        So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>
        With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br><br>

        And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>
        The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
        As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,<br>
        Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
        <br><br>
        He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>
        And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>
        A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
        And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br><br>

        His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>
        His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
        His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
        And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br><br>

        The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
        And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
        He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
        That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.<br><br>

        He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
        And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
        A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
        Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br><br>

        He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
        And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br>
        And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
        And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br><br>

        He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
        And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
        But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br>
        Happy Christmas To All, And To All A Good-Night!
